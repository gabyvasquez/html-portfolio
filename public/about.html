<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Started learning web development in my 20s. Many people might think "Oh! She started late! but there is no age for progress and change. 
  So here I am learning how to make a cool website from scratch. I'm excited!/p>

<p>In this website you can see the projects I've been working on, 
  they showcase my progress and how I'm slowly but surely building a foundation. 
Please let me know if you have any feedback or opportunities for me to continue learning.</p>
